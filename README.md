# Learning Materials for Implementation of LLMs and LLM Techniques

Welcome to the repository for learning materials on the implementation of LLMs and LLM techniques. This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in learning how to build and deploy their own LLMs, or how to use LLMs to solve real-world problems.

## What are LLMs?

LLMs are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that can generate and understand text. LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, and they can be used for a variety of tasks, including:

- Generating text, such as poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.
- Translating languages
- Answering questions in a comprehensive and informative way
- Summarizing text
- Writing different kinds of creative content
- LLM Techniques

This repository contains a variety of learning materials on the implementation of LLMs and LLM techniques. These materials include:

- **Tutorials:** Step-by-step tutorials on how to implement different LLM techniques and applications.
- **Code examples:** Code examples in Python and other programming languages that can be used to implement LLMs and LLM techniques.
- **Papers:** Research papers on the implementation and evaluation of LLMs and LLM techniques.
- **Datasets:** Datasets that can be used to train and evaluate LLMs.

Getting Started

If you are new to LLMs, we recommend starting with the following tutorials:

- Read my Blog on `How LLM works?`: https://medium.com/@gauravtopre9/the-learning-odyssey-how-large-language-models-harness-the-wisdom-of-words-35decd133c2c
- Implementing a Simple LLM in Python: Given in Repo.

We encourage you to contribute to this repository by adding new learning materials, such as tutorials, code examples, papers, and datasets. If you have any suggestions or contributions, please feel free to open a pull request.
